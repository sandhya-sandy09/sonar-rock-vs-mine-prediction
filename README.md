# sonar-rock-vs-mine-prediction

This project uses **Logistic Regression** to classify sonar signals as either a **rock** or a **mine**. The model is trained on a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository containing 60 sonar features per sample.

### ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (LogisticRegression)

### ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Load the dataset (`sonar.csv`)
2. Train the model using Logistic Regression
3. Save and load the model 
4. Predict using new sonar signal data
